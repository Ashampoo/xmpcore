/**
 * Utility services for the metadata object. It has only public static functions, you cannot create
 * an object. These are all functions that layer cleanly on top of the core XMP toolkit.
 *
 * These functions provide support for composing path expressions to deeply nested properties. The
 * functions `XMPMeta` such as `getProperty()`,
 * `getArrayItem()` and `getStructField()` provide easy access to top
 * level simple properties, items in top level arrays, and fields of top level structs. They do not
 * provide convenient access to more complex things like fields several levels deep in a complex
 * struct, or fields within an array of structs, or items of an array that is a field of a struct.
 * These functions can also be used to compose paths to top level array items or struct fields so
 * that you can use the binary accessors like `getPropertyAsInteger()`.
 *
 * You can use these functions is to compose a complete path expression, or all but the last
 * component. Suppose you have a property that is an array of integers within a struct.
 *
 * *Note:* It might look confusing that the schemaNS is passed in all of the calls above.
 * This is because the XMP toolkit keeps the top level &quot;schema&quot; namespace separate from
 * the rest of the path expression.
 *
 * *Note:* These methods are much simpler than in the C++-API, they don't check the given path or array indices.
