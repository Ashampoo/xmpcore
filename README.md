This library is a port of Adobe's XMP SDK to Kotlin Multiplatform by Ashampoo.

It's part of [Ashampoo Photos](https://ashampoo.com/photos).

## Installation

```
implementation("com.ashampoo:xmpcore:0.1.5")
```

## How to use

The library has been designed as a drop-in replacement for users who previously
employed XMP Core Java. Therefore, all the documentation applicable to the
Java SDK also pertains to this library.
However, please note that we have made the decision to remove the functionality for reading
from and writing to ByteArray and InputStreams, as we believe it is unnecessary.

### Sample code

```
val originalXmp: String = "... your XMP ..."

val xmpMeta: XMPMeta = XMPMetaFactory.parseFromString(originalXmp)

val xmpSerializeOptions =
    SerializeOptions()
        .setOmitXmpMetaElement(false)
        .setOmitPacketWrapper(false)
        .setUseCompactFormat(true)
        .setSort(true)

val newXmp = XMPMetaFactory.serializeToString(xmpMeta, xmpSerializeOptions)
```

See the unit tests `ReadXmpTest` and `WriteXmpTest` how to read and manipulate data.

### Migration hint

If you have previously utilized the official XMP Core Java library available on
Maven Central, please make sure to update your imports from `com.adobe.internal.xmp`
to `com.ashampoo.xmp`.
